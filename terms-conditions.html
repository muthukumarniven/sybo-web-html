                            <h6>1. DESCRIPTION OF Sybo.ai</h6>
                            <p>Sybo.ai is conceived as a supportive platform for users seeking assistance with emotional
                                challenges, stresses, and issues they encounter in their daily lives. Our app utilizes
                                advanced AI technology to facilitate conversational interactions through an avatar,
                                aiming to provide users with personalized, insightful guidance.</p>
                            <p>Through engaging video conversations, the avatar in Sybo.ai initiates dialogues by posing
                                a series of thoughtful questions. Users respond verbally, allowing the AI system to
                                gauge and understand their specific situations. The essence of Sybo.ai is to deliver
                                AI-powered suggestions based on the context shared by users, offering prospective
                                pathways to address their challenges.</p>
                            <p>The primary intention of Sybo.ai is not to replace professional advice but to act as an
                                adjunctive tool that complements traditional support systems. The recommendations and
                                insights generated by our AI should be perceived as initial guidance, encouraging users
                                to explore further with qualified professionals where necessary.</p>
                            <p>Beyond providing guidance, Sybo.ai is committed to privacy and security. Every
                                conversation held within the app is securely recorded and stored, accessible solely to
                                the user for replay and personal reflection. This commitment ensures that users can
                                engage with the app confidently, knowing that their interactions remain private and
                                confidential.</p>
                            <p>Sybo.ai also offers flexible usage options, permitting users to initiate new sessions or
                                continue from previous ones, thus fostering an environment of continuous growth and
                                learning. By allowing users to revisit past sessions, the app encourages a deeper
                                understanding of personal progress over time.</p>
                            <p>Through a subscription-based model, Sybo.ai grants users ongoing access to its
                                interactive support system, with scalable plans designed to accommodate varying levels
                                of use. This structured approach makes emotional and psychological support accessible
                                and convenient, meeting users where they are in their journey towards well-being.</p>

                            <p>The Company and the other Company Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of
                                liability — whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or
                                otherwise — for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive or special
                                damages or lost profits, even if you have been advised of the possibility of such
                                damages.</p>

                            <p>The total liability of the Company and the other Company Parties, for any claim arising
                                out of or relating to these Terms or Sybo.ai, regardless of the form of the action, is
                                limited to the amount paid, if any, by you to Use Sybo.ai. In no event will the
                                Company’s total liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms or from the
                                Use of or inability to Use Sybo.ai exceed the amounts you have paid to Use Sybo.ai or
                                ten ($10) U.S. dollars, if you have not had any payment obligations to the Company, as
                                applicable. The exclusion and limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental
                                elements of the basis of the bargain between the Company and you. The limitations set
                                forth in this Section will not limit or exclude liability for fraud or intentional
                                misconduct of the Company or the other Company Parties or for any other matters in which
                                liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some
                                jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
                                damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

                                and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not
                                limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between the

                                have under California Civil Code § 1542 as well as any other statute or common law
                                principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those
                                claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to
                                this release.</p>

                            <h6>15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION</h6>
                            <p>Please read the following Section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain
                                disputes and claims with the Company and limits the manner in which you can seek relief
                                from us.</p>

                            <p>Except for small claims disputes in which you or the Company seek to bring an individual
                                action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes
                                in which you or the Company seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged
                                unlawful use of intellectual property, you and the Company waive your rights to a jury
                                trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or Sybo.ai
                                resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or
                                Sybo.ai will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in Santa Clara
                                County, California in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures
                                (“Rules”) of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are
                                available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference. You either
                                acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your
                                opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or
                                should not apply for any reason.</p>

                            <p>You and the Company agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or
                                Sybo.ai is personal to you and the Company and that any dispute will be resolved solely
                                through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class
                                action or any other type of representative proceeding.</p>

                            <p>You and the Company agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the
                                enforce-ability of this Section 15 will be substantively and procedural governed by the
                                Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (“FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted
                                by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the Rules, the arbitrator will
                                have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any
                                dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided,
                                however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration
                                or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only
                                conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s
                                claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any
                                proceeding involving more than one individual. You and the Company agree that for any
                                arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and the Company will pay the
                                remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by the Company, the Company
                                will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and the Company agree that the state or federal
                                courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in Santa Clara County,
                                California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an
                                arbitration award.</p>

                            <p>ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR Sybo.ai MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE
                                YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS
                                THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM.</p>

                                principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
                                application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between you and the
                                Company that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will
                                be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States,
                                respectively, sitting in Santa Clara County, California.</p>

                            <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to Sybo.ai and
                                your Use of Sybo.ai, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or
                                written understandings or agreements between the Company and you relating to Sybo.ai and
                                your Use of Sybo.ai. The language of these Terms is the English language only. You
                                hereby irrevocably waive any law applicable to you requiring that these Terms shall be
                                localized to meet your language (as well as any other localization requirements), or
                                requiring a delivery or retention of non-electronic records. The failure of us to
                                exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver
                                of such right or provision. The waiver of such right or provision will be effective only
                                if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of the Company. Except as
                                expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies
                                under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or
                                otherwise. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid and unenforceable (either by
                                an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the Dispute Resolution; Binding
                                Arbitration Section above or by court of competent jurisdiction), that provision will be
                                enforceable to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms
                                will remain in full force and effect. The Section titles in these Terms are for
                                convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided
                                herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of you and the Company and are
                                not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
                                You may not assign or transfer your rights under these Terms, by operation of law or
                                otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer
                                your rights under these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. We
                                may freely assign or transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms without
                                restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of
